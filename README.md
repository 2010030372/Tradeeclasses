#PREPROCESSING 

Stop words removal 
Punctuations removal 
Special characters,numbers removal 
converting data into lowercase
lemmatization

#MODELS USED 

1.NAIVE BAYES - ACCURACY(70) 

2.LOGISTIC REGRESSION -  ACCURACY(80) 

3.SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE -  ACCURACY(81) 

4.RANDOM FOREST -  ACCURACY(79) 

# So as SVM accuracy is good.WE will be using SVM model in this project
